# ColleXions
ColleXions automates the process of pinning collections to your Plex home screen, making it easier to showcase your favorite content. With customizable features, it enhances your Plex experience by dynamically adjusting what is displayed, randomly.

## Key Features
- **Randomized Pinning:** ColleXions randomly selects collections to pin each cycle, ensuring that your home screen remains fresh and engaging. This randomness prevents the monotony of static collections, allowing users to discover new content easily.

- **Special Occasion Collections:** Automatically prioritizes collections linked to specific dates, making sure seasonal themes are highlighted when appropriate.

- **Exclusion List:** Users can specify collections to exclude from pinning, ensuring that only the most relevant or desired collections are featured.

- **Customizable Settings:** Users can easily adjust library names, pinning intervals, and the number of collections to pin, tailoring the experience to their preferences.
